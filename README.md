# CI301FinalProject

This is the final implementation of my final year university project in which an enemy AI will adapt to a playstyle
based on a users previous inputs. The build of this game are an early prototype of a fighting game based on Street Fighter 2. To run the game
double click on CI301.exe, when prompted press the escape key and re open the application for the desired effect to 
take place. Once you have ran the application at least ten times you should see that the AI will adapt to your playstyle.
A survey was conducted alongside the creation of this program, in which 60% of users prefer this form of AI to generic
fighting game AI. To see the full results of the survey please contact the repository owner.
